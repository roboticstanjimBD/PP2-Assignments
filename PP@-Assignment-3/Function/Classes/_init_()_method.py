"""The __init__() Method
All classes have a built-in method called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

The __init__() method is used to assign values to object properties, or to perform operations that are necessary when the object is being created."""

#ExampleGet your own Python Server
#Create a class named Person, use the __init__() method to assign values for name and age:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("Emil", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)


"""Why Use __init__()?
Without the __init__() method, you would need to set properties manually for each object:

Example
Create a class without __init__():"""

class Person:
  pass

p1 = Person()
p1.name = "Tobias"
p1.age = 25

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)

"""Using __init__() makes it easier to create objects with initial values:

"""


class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("Linus", 28)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)

"""Multiple Parameters
The __init__() method can have as many parameters as you need:"""

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age, city, country):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    self.city = city
    self.country = country

p1 = Person("Linus", 30, "Oslo", "Norway")

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
print(p1.city)
print(p1.country)
